“... really he can have chemistry with a pebble.” _-Phoebe Waller-Bridge, regarding working with Andrew Scott on "Fleabag"_

NFL pundits often refer to the role of chemistry in describing the coordinated performance and shared situational awareness of teammates on the football field. The goal of this project is to develop methods and analyses that allow for users to identify those NFL players who show great chemistry (1) with specific other players, and (2) tend to elevate the play of others in general. Thanks to the folks at Establish the Run, whose comedic use of the "shower narrative" label that NFL and fantasy football fans use to reference this chemistry had inspired this work.
